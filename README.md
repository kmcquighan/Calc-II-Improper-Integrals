# Calc-II-Improper-Integrals
This interactive Notebook introduces you to what Improper Integrals are and how to compute them using limits. It also explains why such integrals are "improper" by reviewing the defintion of an integral. 

You can either download the files and run the Notebook on your local machine or you can launch the Notebook by clicking on the mybinder.org link below.

Note: the mybinder.org servers are not always running. If you're having difficulty launching the notebook please check the status of the servers at http://mybinder.org/status

If you download the files to your computer make sure that you have the ImpropIntTools.py file: these are the backend functions that create the simulations in the notebook.
